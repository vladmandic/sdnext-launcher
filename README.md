- **No setup hassles** — All dependencies bundled. `Python` and `Git` included, nothing extra to install.
- **One-click installation** — Just download the `EXE` and run. The installer guides you through everything.
- **Customizable setup** — Choose which GPU backend (*CUDA, ROCm, Zluda, IPex, DirectML, OpenVino*), where to install, and advanced options.
- **Built-in launcher** — After installation, launch SD.Next directly from the app. No command line needed.
- **Real-time progress** — Watch the install/launch unfold with live terminal output and helpful status updates.

## System Requirements

- **Windows 10 or Windows 11**
- **6+ GB free disk space**: For SD.Next and dependencies
- **Internet connection**: For downloading the application during installation
- **No admin rights required**: Standard user privileges are enough
- **Zero contamination**: The installer does not modify any files outside of its own directory

## Installation Steps

1. **Download** `SD.Next-<version>.exe` or `SD.Next-<version>.zip` and run it
2. **Bootstrap** — On first run, click "Bootstrap" to unpack the bundled tools
3. **Configure** — Adjust your settings: GPU type, installation paths, startup options, etc.
4. **Install** — Click "Install" and let the app set everything up
5. **Launch** — Once installation completes, click "Launch" to run SD.Next

> [!NOTE]
> **Exe** and **Zip** versions are the same under the hood  
> **Exe** self-extracts before running which may take a few seconds before app starts  
> **Zip** requires manual extraction but once extracted it's fully ready, so it may start faster  

> [!NOTE]
> The entire process takes 10-30 minutes depending on your internet speed and hardware.

Installer creates **sdnext** folder (configurable) with subfolders:
- `bin/`: contains `git` and `python` portable executables
- `venv/`: contains virtual environment with all SD.Next dependencies
- `app/`: contains SD.Next application files
